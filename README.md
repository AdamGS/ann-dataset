A lightweight research library for managing Approximate Nearest Neighbor search datasets.

It offers the following features:
  * Storage of dense, sparse, and dense-sparse vector sets;
  * Storage of query sets with ground-truth (i.e., exact nearest neighbors) according to different metrics;
  * Basic functionality such as computing recall given a retrieved set; and,
  * Serialization into and deserialization from HDF5 file format.
